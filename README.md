### Hi, I'm Arnau 👋

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University. Currently, interested in applying AI to improve how we simulate physical and social systems. Checkout my latest research and publications on my personal website (www.arnau.ai).

- 🐧 Checkout my latest software package to calibrate differentiable simulators, with specific emphasis on variational inference for differentiable agent-based models [code](https://github.com/arnauqb/blackbirds) [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05776)
- :bug:I've worked a lot on epidemiological differentiable simulators. I am a core developer of [JUNE](https://github.com/IDAS-Durham/JUNE) and I have recently developed a [differentiable implementation](github.com/arnauqb/gradabm-june).
- ⭐I love the Julia programming language and I have used it to implement a [simulator of black-hole outflows with radiation transfer](github.com/arnauqb/Qwind.jl).
